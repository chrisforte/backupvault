# Privacy Policy

### Overview

**Chris Forte Development** or **Chris Forte** (“we” or “us” or “our”) respects the privacy
of our users (“user” or “you”). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use,
disclose, and safeguard your information when you use Backup Vault (the
“Application”).   Please read this Privacy Policy carefully.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE
WITH THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT ACCESS THE
APPLICATION.

We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time and for any
reason.  We will alert you about any changes by updating the “Last updated” date of
this Privacy Policy.  You are encouraged to periodically review this Privacy Policy to
stay informed of updates. You will be deemed to have been made aware of, will be
subject to, and will be deemed to have accepted the changes in any revised Privacy
Policy by your continued use of the Application after the date such revised Privacy
Policy is posted.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to the third-party online/application store from
which you install the Application or make payments, including any in-application
virtual items, which may also collect and use data about you.  We are not responsible
for any of the data collected by any such third party.

### Collection of your information

No personal information is collected in any way. **Backup Vault** ("the application") does
not collect any personal information from any file or folder it accesses during the
backup process. File names and file sizes are saved in a database file on the machine
running the application. This information is used for backup purposes only and is
never shared or accessible from outside the application.

The application utilizes the [Visual Studio App Center](https://appcenter.ms) SDK to
collect error data, crash logs, and other application events. The application respects
the system-wide Diagnostic Data collection level selected by the user in Windows
Settings; if the 'Basic' or 'Security' levels are selected, only crash data and error data
are collected. If the 'Full' or 'Enhanced' levels are selected, crash data, error data, and
application events are collected. The application events that are collected through the
App Center SDK contain the same information as the logs that are generated and
stored locally in the application.

More information about Diagnostics, feedback, and privacy in Windows 10 can be
[found here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4468236/diagnostics-feedback-and-privacy-in-windows-10-microsoft-privacy).

More information about Visual Studio App Center privacy can be [found here](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement) and

### Disclosure of your information

No personal information is shared in any way.

We are not responsible for the actions of third parties with whom you share personal
or sensitive data, and we have no authority to manage or control third-party
solicitations.  If you no longer wish to receive correspondence, emails or other
communications from third parties, you are responsible for contacting the third party
directly.

### Tracking Technologies

The application utilizes the [Visual Studio App Center](https://appcenter.ms) SDK to
collect application events, including time spent using the application, number of uses
per day, and navigation within the application. No personally identifiable information
("PII") is collected.

### Security of your information

We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your 
personal information.  While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the personal
information you provide to us, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security
measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be
guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse.  Any information
disclosed online is vulnerable to interception and misuse by unauthorized parties.
Therefore, we cannot guarantee complete security if you provide personal
information.

### California privacy rights

California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the “Shine The Light” law,
permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a
year and free of charge, information about categories of personal information (if any)
we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and
addresses of all third parties with which we shared personal information in the
immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to
make such a request, please submit your request in writing to us using the contact
information provided below.

If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a registered account
with the Application, you have the right to request removal of unwanted data that you
publicly post on the Application. To request removal of such data, please contact us
using the contact information provided below, and include the email address
associated with your account and a statement that you reside in California.  We will
make sure the data is not publicly displayed on the Application, but please be aware
that the data may not be completely or comprehensively removed from our systems.
